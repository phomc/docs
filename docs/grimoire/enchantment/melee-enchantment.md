| 3     | 40%    | 60%           |
| 4     | 45%    | 70%           |

### 1. Dash
Has a chance to surf forward and deal damage to passed mobs:

| Level | Chance | Damage Percentage | Radius |
|-------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| 1     | 40%    | 60%               | 0.5    |
| 2     | 50%    | 70%               | 0.6    |
| 3     | 60%    | 80%               | 0.7    |
| 4     | 75%    | 100%              | 0.7    |

- `Additional damage = Damage on first attack * damage percentage`
- Damage cooldown is removed which means it is possible to attack a single mob multiple times

The durability is reduced by 1 for every extra attack.
